| Checkbox (right panel)                  | A unique file extension e.g. `.txt` that was found in the left panel's checked/selected file/directory/folder checkbox(-es), which is inserted as checkbox(-es) in the right-hand panel.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| Sort Files                              | Moves all existing checked/selected file extensions from the previously checked/selected folders to the user (or default) selected save/output directory/folder. The folders that are scanned for the file extensions, are calculated/considered/selected based on when the ***Scan for file extensions*** button is used. The ***Sort Files*** button therefore only considers the checked/selected file extensions checkbox(-es) in this step.<br/>ðŸ“Œ**Note**: This step cannot be un-done. |
